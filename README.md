# Relational Databases & API Rest Development: E-Commerce API Project

This is the code written during the live event covering this project.
Feel free to use this as starter code for your project.

I strongly recommended going through Lesson 3: Intro to ORMs and Lesson 5: Building RESTful APIs with Flask a second time prior to attempting this project.
I'd encourage you to code alongside the instructor in Lesson 5 and fully build-out the Pet project showcased in the curriculum.

It should help you immensely in understanding how to complete this project, which is distinctly similar.
